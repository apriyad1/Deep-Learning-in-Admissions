# Admission Prediction in Undergraduate Applications: an Interpretable Deep Learning Approach

Our paper "Admission Prediction in Undergraduate Applications: an Interpretable Deep Learning Approach" has been published in the Fifth International Conference on Transdisciplinary AI. Here is the link to the Full arxived version of the paper.

## Paper Description

The paper addresses the challenges associated with admissions decision-making process for Undergraduate admissions. It proposes the Deep-Learning based classifiers to overcome the challenges, such as scaling and bias, faced by the existing traditional methods and classical Machine Learning techniques. Furthermore, additional insights into the model's prediction is obtained by the usage of LIME (Locally Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) model.
